# Analyze Business Process Description

Thoroughly review the business-process-description.md file to understand the business process and entities involved.

## Analysis Focus Areas:

1. **Entity Consistency Check**: Look for inconsistencies between the Roles, Entities, Entity Descriptions, Operations and User Stories.

2. **Missing Components Identification**:
   - Missing entities or entity descriptions
   - Missing operations in the business-process-description.md file
   - Missing User Stories in the business-process-description.md file

3. **User Story Completeness**: Particularly look for missing user stories, especially negative cases that test unintended behavior by the roles.

## Expected Output:

Provide clear recommendations for any missing entities, entity descriptions, operations, or user stories. Give very clear reasons why you feel something is missing, especially if you think there is an inconsistency between the Roles, Entities, Entity Descriptions, Operations and User Stories.

Focus on suggesting changes rather than making direct edits to the business-process-description.md file.
