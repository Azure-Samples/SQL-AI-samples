# SQL-AI-samples

## About this repo

This repo hosts samples meant to help design AI applications built on data from an Azure SQL Database. We illustrate key technical concepts and demonstrate workflows that integrate Azure SQL data with other popular AI application components inside and outside of Azure. 

## Description of samples

### Azure SQL ACS Samples
The [AzureSQL_CogSearch_IntegratedVectorization](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/SQL-AI-samples/blob/main/AzureSQLACSSamples/src/AzureSQL_CogSearch_IntegratedVectorization.ipynb) sample notebook shows an example AI application that recommends products based on a database of user reviews, using Azure Cognitive Search to store and search the relevant data. It highlights new preview features of Azure Cognitive Search, including automatic chunking and integrated vectorization of user queries.

### Azure SQL Promptflow Samples

## Getting started
